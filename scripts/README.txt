## If this file was opened automatically after setup
-------

If this file was automatically opened after running setup, that means that everything is setup already.
This also means that there is a file explorer open. Do not close it as you will need it later.

The script will now prompt 'Press [Enter] to continue...'. Before pressing [Enter], make sure you read this.

When you press the [Enter] key, it will open up Visual Studio Solution for this project for you. 
This is where you can edit the source code. *Hint*: the file 'game_run.cpp' is where it all begins....

When you want to compile, remember that file explorer that popped open automatically, I hope you listened
and didn't close the file explorer :)! 

Anyways, from the file explorer, just double click (run) 'run.bat'.
The 'run.bat' script will compile the modified code (or nothing if you didn't change anything). There won't be anything
displayed during the compile process (I'm just too lazy to do it). You just have to wait patiently for it to compile.

When it is done compiling, it will create and move necessary files, and try to run the game. 

If all goes well, it will launch immediately to the game, and you're done!!
Congratulations, you have successfully modified and compile the game (if you modified it)

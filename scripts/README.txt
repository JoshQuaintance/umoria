# Scripts Directions

----

## First Steps

If this file was opened automatically after running first time setup, it is likely that everything is setup for you already, except for the first time compile. PLEASE PLEASE WAIT FOR THE FIRST TIME COMPILE TO BE DONE!. There would also be a file explorer open, and you don't want to close this, because we will need it later.

After the first time compile is done (which the command prompt for it will close), the main script will now prompt 'Press [Enter] to continue....'. Before pressing [Enter], make sure you read this thoroughly.

## Editing

Anyways, after you press the [Enter] key after the first time compile is done, it should open up Visual Studio to the umoria project for you. This is where you can edit the source code. *\*Hint\**: The file 'game_run.cpp' is where it all begins....

#### Other Editors

If you want to use a different editor to edit the source code, you can! You just have to open the 'src' folder in the editor you choose. Because the compiler is just another script that I made, you can use any editor, for all I care you can use Notepad (not Notepad++ :) ).



## Compiling and Running

When you want to compile, remember that file explorer that opened by itself, I hope you listened and didn't close the file explorer because we are going to need it now!

If you didn't listen (rude) and closed the file explorer, you're fine. Just open the 'script' file inside the root folder.

Anyways, from the file explorer, just double click/run the file **'run.bat'**.

The **'run.bat'** batch file will compile the modified code (or nothing if you didn't change anything). There won't be anything displayed on the command prompt while it's compiling (because I'm too lazy to forward the compile output into the script output), so you have to be patient about it.

When it's done compiling, it will create and move files as necessary, and try to run the game.



## Final Step

If all goes well, the game will run immediately to the game, and voila, you're set!!
Congratulations, you have successfully modified and compiled your own version of the game!!!

ENJOY!!!! :)
